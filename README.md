  Aurore Storefront Starter
</h1>

> **Prerequisites**: To use the starter you should have the Aurore Medusa server running locally on port 9000 or deployed. Check out [aurore-medusa](https://github.com/traleor/aurore-medusa) for a quick setup.

# Overview

![aurore-cover](https://github.com/traleor/aurore-frontend/blob/main/public/cover.png)

## [Live Demo](https://aurore-storefront.herokuapp.com/)

Aurore is a Multi-vendor marketplace built using Medusa, Wagtail for the CMS and Next.Js for the Front-end.
This marketplace is easy to maintain and update to the latest Medusa version as it is built entirely with the tools provided by Medusa (no third-party included).

### Preview
![Demo]()

The Medusa Next.js Starter is built with:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Medusa](https://medusajs.com/)

# Quickstart

## Setting up the environment variables

Navigate into your projects directory and get your enviroment variables ready:

```shell
cd nextjs-starter-medusa/
mv .env.template .env.local
```

### Install dependencies

Use Yarn, PNPM or NPM to install all dependencies.

```shell
yarn
# 
pnpm i
# 
npm i
```

### Start developing

You are now ready to start up your project.

```shell
yarn dev
# 
pnpm dev
# 
npm dev
```

### Open the code and start customizing

Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

Edit `/pages/index.tsx` to see your site update in real-time!

# Payment integrations

By default this starter supports the following payment integrations

- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/)

To enable the integrations you need to add the following to your `.env.local` file:

```shell
MEDUSA_PAYMENT_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your-stripe-public-key>
MEDUSA_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=<your-paypal-client-id>
```

You will also need to setup the integrations in your Medusa server. See the [Medusa documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com) for more information on how to configure [Stripe](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/stripe) and [PayPal](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/paypal) in your Medusa project.

# Search integration

This starter is configured to support using the `medusa-search-meilisearch` plugin out of the box. To enable search you will need to enable the feature flag in `./store-config.json`, which you do by changing the config to this:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "search": true
  }
}
```

Before you can search you will need to install the plugin in your Medusa server, for a written guide on how to do this – [see our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/meilisearch).

The search components in this starter are developed with Algolia's `react-instant-search-hooks-web` library which should make it possible for you to seemlesly change your search provider to Algoli instead of MeiliSearch.

To do this you will need to add `algoliasearch` to the project, by running

```shell
yarn add algoliasearch
```

After this you will need to switch the current MeiliSearch `SearchClient` out with a Alogolia client. To do this update `@lib/search-client`.

```ts
import algoliasearch from "algoliasearch/lite"

const appId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SEARCH_APP_ID || "test_app_id" // You should add this to your environment variables

const apiKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SEARCH_API_KEY || "test_key"

export const searchClient = algoliasearch(appId, apiKey)

export const SEARCH_INDEX_NAME =
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEX_NAME || "products"
```

After this you will need to set up Algolia with your Medusa server, and then you should be good to go. For a more thorough walkthrough of using Algolia with Medusa – [see our documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/add-plugins/algolia), and the [documentation for using `react-instantsearch-hooks-web`](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/getting-started/react-hooks/).
